# NormalDistrGeneration

Project for Monte Carlo simulation class.

Project 5. Implement and compare various methods for generating random variables from the
normal distribution (see Sect. 4.5). Using some statistical software (e.g., R, Mathematica)
compare statistical properties of their numerical outputs for various number of the samples.
Numerically compare speed of the implemented methods.
